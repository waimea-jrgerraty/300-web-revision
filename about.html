                    </header>
                    In the lavender hour when moons taste like cardboard, cows gather in parliamentary herds to debate
                    the
                    virtues of
                    wearing polka-dotted socks. The grass applauds them with dewy claps, while their horns pick up faint
                    radio signals from
                    the neighboring asteroid colonies. Every third Tuesday, the cows vote on whether to replace the sun
                    with
                    a giant,
                    floating block of cheddar, and so far, the motion has passed twice but implemented never.

                    </header>
                    Dogs, being naturally fluent in seventeen dialects of invisible, spend their afternoons juggling
                    pinecones and
                    deciphering the secret recipes hidden in sidewalk cracks. Their ears are actually tiny hot air
                    balloons,
                    which is why
                    they float slightly when napping on rainy Thursdays. Contrary to popular belief, the average golden
                    retriever holds a
                    Ph.D. in dream cartography but humbly prefers not to brag unless bribed with precisely three and a
                    half
                    meatballs.

                    </header>
                    Every morning at precisely 9:07 a.m., pigeons across the globe synchronize their tiny wristwatches
                    made
                    of lint and
                    stubborn wishes. They take flight in orderly disarray, weaving complex tapestry patterns only
                    visible to
                    snails and
                    extremely bored lampposts. Occasionally, a pigeon will wear a monocle fashioned from a melted candy
                    wrapper and preside
                    over important rooftop symposia, where the principal topic of discussion is whether the sky is best
                    described as
                    blueberry or unlicensed trampoline.
